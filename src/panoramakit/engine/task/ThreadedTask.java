 * Threaded tasks are tasks that run in a separate thread in the background. Some tasks run for a
 * long time without any natural pauses, so to avoid freezing up Minecraft, it's better to put them
 * in a separate thread. Threaded tasks are executed automatically after the init method has been
 * called, so there is no need to manually execute them. All threaded code goes into performThreaded
 * which gets executed once you run start(). Threaded tasks can also utilize the perform() which 
 * triggers every frame just like with normal tasks.
