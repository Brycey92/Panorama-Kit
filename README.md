PanoramaKit 3.0
===========

This forge-compatible version of Panorama Kit is a complete rewrite from previous versions of the mod. The mod is in the public domain, so anyone is allowed to use the code however they want.

Credits goes to the author of [MineShot](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1081702-16x-mineshot-142-create-bigger-and-better-screenshots/ "-> Minecraft Forum") whose source code (also under public domain) helped me significantly improve the structure of this mod.
